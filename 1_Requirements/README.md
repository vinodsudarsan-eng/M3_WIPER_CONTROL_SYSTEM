# 3.4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)
 
 ## WHO
   * A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper *controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions*
 ## WHAT
   * High reliability.
 ## WHEN
   * When it rains, the wiper control system is used
 ## WHERE
   * In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.
 ## HOW
   * You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
# 4.SWOT(STRENGTH,WEAKNESS,OPPORTUNITY,THREATS)

 ## STRENGTHS
   1. Budget-friendly project
   2. free from wear adjustment
   3. Power consumption is reduced
   4. The operation principle is very simple and installation is easy
   5. By providing ON/OFF push buttons, it can be operated manually or automatically
 ## WEAKNESSES
   1. A cost increase is required if an optical sensor is used
   2. This system applied in the case of water falling on the glass only
 ## OPPORTUNITY
  * Essentially, the wiper system is designed to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide adequate visibility at all times.
 ## THREATS
   1. Noise occurs due to slackness or tightness of the mechanical drive system. Also it occurs when the moving parts in the linkage come in contact with other parts         such as the metal tubing of the screen washer tube.
   2. When noise is not found through a visual inspection, then each part is checked independently Flexible racks are checked for tightness, and also the force               required to move the rack through the tube is measured when it is disconnected from the motor and wheel-box. A maximum force of 27 N is a typical value.
