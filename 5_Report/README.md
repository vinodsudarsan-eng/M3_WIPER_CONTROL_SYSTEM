## INTRODUCTION 
Wiper system is an important component in all the vehicle system. They consist of
ac motor fitted with arm which cleans the windshield surface of both front and rear
windshield. Modern day cars also poses automatic sensing operation using Rain
sensor which basically consists of LED that detects the amount of water on the
windshield.
Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched
ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of
safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. With drivers exposed
to an ever increasing number of distractions, rain-sensing wiper systems become an
even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take
his/her hands off the wheel. Most traditional systems offer intermittent as well as
variable speed operation. The traditional wiper system however requires driver
constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed
constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed. Because the manual
adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause
accident wiper automatically cording to the amount of water on the windshield and
in addition with also in advance removal of moisture inside the car while raining. The
majority of motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, locomotives, watercraft
with enclosed cabins, and some aircraft, are fitted with one or more such wipers,
which are usually legal requirements. Wiper system improve visibility of driving and
can be considered as an integral part of the vehicle safety system.

## OBJECTIVES
The design and implementation is divided into different objectives and 
outcomes. Below are the list of objectives- 
• To move wiper when ignition starts
• To move wiper to clean the windshield

## COMPONENT ANALYSIS 
STM32F407V4
The STM32F4 Discovery board is small devices based on STMF4, which is a highperformance microcontroller. This board allows users to develop and design 
applications. It has multiple modules within itself which allows the user to 
communicate and design the interface of different kinds without relying on any 
third device. The board has all the modern system modules peripherals like ADC 
and DAC, audio port, UART, etc which makes it one of the best-developing 
devices. The device may be for developing modern applications but some 
protocols will need to be followed to use the device, like the compiler, voltage 
potential, etc. In this tutorial, we will discuss swd pinout, pin configuration, pin 
description, features, and exampleS

The STM32F4 has two male headers P1 and P2, both headers are connected to port A, C, D, E & H which will be used for further functions.

## Pushbuttons 
A push switch (button) is a momentary or non-latching switch which causes a temporary change in the state of an electrical circuit only while the switch is physically  actuated. After a circuit is interrupted, an automatic mechanism (i.e. a spring) returns the switch to its default position, restoring the initial condition of the circuit.
